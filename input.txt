Over the course of nearly 200 years, technology has quickly become a central figure in our lives. The ability to automate tasks that previously took intolerable amounts of grueling labor has undeniably improved quality of life all around. As of late, the computer has lain at the forefront of this modern renaissance, further bolstering our ability to automate by allowing us to perform complex operations at speeds previously unthinkable. With the advent of the personal computer, this groundbreaking technology was placed in the hands of the common citizen. Today, computers have done nothing short of revolutionize our daily lives. However, new technologies just over the horizon are poised to once again to shatter everything we thought we knew about the limits of computation. Soon, we will be able to use this technology to yet again revolutionize the way we solve problems; we’ll be able to make calculations never before seen at speeds never before heard of. I’m speaking, of course, of the ever-nearing reality of quantum computing.
Modern computers are already capable of completing a plethora of tasks far faster than any human possibly could. However, they do have their limitations. Put simply, computers operate based on information they are fed in the form of data known as “bits”.  These bits are binary, in that they can only exist as either ones or zeroes, much as a lightswitch can only be on or off. Since bits can only be in one of these states at a time, some limitations arise when it comes to complex calculations, such as factoring very large numbers. Quantum computers, however, operate in a manner that can circumvent these limits.
